## Idea 1: Network Load Simulation

Some kind of RTS thing where the player needs to distribute the load of a system?
They can place down servers on a world map and create links between the servers to handle traffic.
Gradually they get more demand from different groups and they need to place down servers.
Maybe it would work like a puzzle game with scripted traffic amounts coming from different areas.
I'd kind of like something more action-oriented though.

## Idea 2: War Zone Radio Infrastructure

Maybe a first person shooter where the player can go around placing and maintaining radio infrastructure.
Since it's a war zone the players may get shot by bots.
It's a bit too complex to be done in the time frame though.

## Idea 3: Net game

Needs too many players to work for Global Game Jam.
