## Idea 1: Network Load Simulation

Some kind of RTS thing where the player needs to distribute the load of a system?
They can place down servers on a world map and create links between the servers to handle traffic.
Gradually they get more demand from different groups and they need to place down servers.
Maybe it would work like a puzzle game with scripted traffic amounts coming from different areas.
I'd kind of like something more action-oriented though.
